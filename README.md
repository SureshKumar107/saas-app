🤖 Introduction
Build and launch a full-featured LMS SaaS application from scratch using Next.js, Supabase, and Stripe. This project includes user authentication, subscription-based access, and secure payment integration. You'll also incorporate real-time learning capabilities with Vapi's AI voice agent, enabling dynamic, interactive teaching sessions for a next-generation learning experience.

⚙️ Tech Stack
-> Clerk is a unified platform for authentication, user management, and billing. It offers embeddable UI components, flexible APIs, and admin dashboards for secure user management. Clerk also simplifies subscription management, allowing you to define plans, create pricing pages, and control access based on subscription tiers—all in one solution.

-> Next.js is a powerful React framework that enables the development of fast, scalable web applications with features like server-side rendering, static site generation, and API routes for building full-stack applications.

-> Sentry is an error tracking and performance monitoring tool that helps developers fix bugs faster by providing real-time alerts, stack traces, and performance insights.

-> shadcn/ui is a customizable component library built on Radix UI and Tailwind CSS. It offers a modern, accessible design system with pre-built components that are easy to theme and extend, making it ideal for building polished UIs with minimal effort.

->Supabase is an open-source backend-as-a-service platform that provides instant APIs, real-time subscriptions, authentication, storage, and a PostgreSQL database, enabling developers to build scalable and secure applications with ease.

-> Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that allows developers to design custom user interfaces by applying low-level utility classes directly in HTML, streamlining the design process.

-> TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that adds static typing, providing better tooling, code quality, and error detection for developers, making it ideal for building large-scale applications.

-> Vapi is a developer-centric voice AI platform that enables the creation of conversational voice agents with low-latency voice interactions, speech-to-text, and text-to-speech capabilities. It supports multilingual conversations, customizable voices, and seamless integration with various AI models and tools.

-> Zod is a TypeScript-first schema validation library that provides a simple and expressive way to define and validate data structures. Zod ensures data integrity by catching errors early during development.
